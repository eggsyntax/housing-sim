## Project Overview

This is an interactive JavaScript simulation of a housing market designed to explore economic dynamics, wealth distribution effects, and market behaviors. The simulation models discrete-time market interactions between buyers, sellers, and properties, with particular focus on emergent behaviors arising from wealth inequality and market turnover.

### Primary Goals
- ✅ Create a realistic yet simplified model of housing market dynamics
- ⏳ Enable exploration of specific scenarios (e.g., wealthy downsizing) *[Phase 3]*
- ✅ Provide both console-based and graphical interfaces for observation
- ✅ Support economic research and educational use
- ✅ Demonstrate emergent market behaviors from simple rules

### Target Audience
- Economics students and researchers
- Policy makers exploring housing market dynamics
- Anyone interested in complex system behaviors

## System Explanation

### Core Concepts

**Time Model**: The simulation operates in discrete time steps called "ticks," each representing one year. Time begins at year 2025 and progresses forward with each simulation step.

**Market Participants**: The market consists of people (representing households) who can own at most one house. Each person has a wealth value that represents their total purchasing power, used exclusively for housing.

**Housing Stock**: The market contains a fixed number of houses, each with two key value components:
- **Intrinsic Value**: An inherent quality/desirability factor (fixed at initialization)
- **Market Price History**: The last price paid for the house

**Hybrid Value System**: Each house's perceived value is calculated as:
```
house_value = value_intrinsicness * intrinsic_value + (1 - value_intrinsicness) * last_selling_price
```
Where `value_intrinsicness` is a configurable parameter (0-1) controlling how much intrinsic quality vs. market price influences desirability.

### Market Mechanics

**Wealth Distribution**: Initial wealth follows a power law distribution to approximate real-world wealth inequality. New entrants receive randomly assigned wealth from the same distribution.

**Auction System**: Houses are sold through Vickrey (sealed-bid, second-price) auctions where:
- All interested parties bid simultaneously
- Highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid amount
- If only one bidder, they pay 75% of their bid
- Bidders always bid their total wealth (simplified strategy)

**Bidding Strategy**: People bid on the highest-value house they can afford, with two behavioral rules:
1. **Affordability**: Only bid on houses with value ≤ their wealth
2. **Upgrade Threshold**: Existing homeowners only bid if available house value > upgrade_threshold × current_house_value

**Batch Auction System**: To create realistic market dynamics, available houses are divided into sequential auction batches. In each batch, bidders can only participate in one auction, preventing wealthy individuals from monopolizing all available properties simultaneously.

### Simulation Flow (Per Tick)

1. **Exit Phase**: `turnover_out` randomly selected people sell their houses and exit the market
2. **Entry Phase**: `turnover_in` new people enter with randomly assigned wealth
3. **Auction Setup**: Available houses (from exits + previous moves) are divided into `n_auction_steps` batches
4. **Auction Execution**: Sequential Vickrey auctions with brief pauses between batches
5. **Move Completion**: Winners move to new houses, their old houses become available for next tick
6. **Display Update**: Both console and graphical displays show new market state

### Key Behaviors and Emergent Properties

**Wealth Stratification**: Over time, the wealthiest individuals tend to acquire the most valuable houses, creating market stratification that reflects wealth inequality.

**Market Fluidity**: The combination of turnover and upgrade thresholds prevents the market from becoming completely static, maintaining ongoing transaction activity.

**Price Discovery**: The Vickrey auction mechanism ensures that market prices reflect the second-highest valuation, creating efficient price discovery.

**Cascade Effects**: When wealthy individuals move to more expensive houses, they free up mid-tier housing for less wealthy buyers, creating market cascades.

### Scenario System

The simulation supports predefined scenarios that can be triggered at specific years or manually during runtime:

**Downsizing Scenario**: At a specified year, a configurable percentage of the wealthiest homeowners decide to sell their current houses and purchase lower-value properties. This tests market response to sudden changes in demand patterns.

**Future Scenario Types** (extensible design):
- Economic shocks (sudden wealth changes)
- Policy interventions (transaction taxes, subsidies)
- Demographic changes (age-based preferences)
- Supply shocks (new construction, natural disasters)

### Parameters and Configuration

All simulation parameters are configurable to enable experimentation:

**Population Parameters**:
- `num_houses`: Total number of houses in the market
- `num_people`: Initial number of people in the market
- `wealth_mean`: Mean wealth for power law distribution
- `wealth_std`: Standard deviation for wealth distribution

**Housing Parameters**:
- `house_price_mean`: Mean initial house price
- `house_price_std`: Standard deviation for initial house prices
- `value_intrinsicness`: Weight of intrinsic vs. market value (0-1)

**Market Dynamics Parameters**:
- `turnover_in`: Number of people entering per tick
- `turnover_out`: Number of people exiting per tick
- `upgrade_threshold`: Minimum value ratio for homeowner bidding
- `n_auction_steps`: Number of sequential auction batches per tick

**Simulation Parameters**:
- `simulation_speed`: Milliseconds between ticks
- `starting_year`: Initial year for simulation

### Expected Behaviors

**Short-term**: Initial random distribution leads to sorting as wealthy individuals acquire valuable properties through auction processes.

**Medium-term**: Market reaches quasi-equilibrium with ongoing turnover maintaining transaction activity. Wealth-based stratification becomes apparent.

**Long-term**: Stable stratification with regular turnover creating opportunities for social mobility through the housing market.

**Scenario Testing**: Downsizing events should create temporary market disruptions with interesting redistribution effects as high-value properties become available to middle-wealth buyers.

### Data Flow Architecture

**Text-First Design**: All simulation logic outputs to console first, then renderer translates to graphics. This ensures that the core simulation remains debuggable and that graphics are purely additive.

**Event-Driven Updates**: The renderer listens for market events and updates display accordingly, maintaining separation between simulation logic and presentation.

**Configuration-Driven**: All parameters are externalized in a configuration object, making experimentation easy and supporting different simulation presets.
